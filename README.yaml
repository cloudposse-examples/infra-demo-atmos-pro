introduction: |-
  This is an advanced example repository that demonstrates how to use Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment. It provides a comprehensive setup with multiple components and dependencies to showcase how Atmos Pro handles complex infrastructure workflows.

  ### Installation

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Prerequisites for Using Atmos CLI</strong></summary>

  In order to trigger workflows from this GitHub repository, the Atmos Pro GitHub App will execute `atmos` on your behalf in GitHub Actions. You do not need to install anything locally.

  However if you wish to execute `atmos` locally, you will need to install Atmos. For installation instructions, visit the [Atmos installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install).

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Required Prerequisites for Using Atmos Pro (Advanced Example)</strong></summary>

  The following prerequisites are **required** to use this advanced example with real infrastructure:

  #### Required Infrastructure Components

  This advanced example requires three infrastructure components to be deployed:

  1. **Terraform State Backend** - Remote state storage (S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state locking)
  2. **Terraform Plan Storage Backend** - Plan file storage (S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for storing Terraform plans between planning and applying phases)
  3. **GitHub OIDC Integration** - Secure authentication (GitHub OIDC provider and IAM roles for GitHub Actions to authenticate with AWS)

  #### Deployment Options

  You can deploy these infrastructure components using one of the following approaches:

  **Option A: Use our reference architecture**
  - For Terraform state backend setup: [Initialize Terraform State Backend](https://docs.cloudposse.com/layers/accounts/initialize-tfstate/)
  - For plan storage setup: [Setup GitOps with GitHub Actions](https://docs.cloudposse.com/layers/gitops/setup/)
  - For GitHub OIDC setup: [How to use GitHub OIDC with AWS](https://docs.cloudposse.com/layers/github-actions/github-oidc-with-aws/)

  **Option B: Use the CloudFormation template**
  - Deploy all three components at once using the [CloudFormation template for Terraform backend](https://github.com/cloudposse/aws-cloudformation-terraform-backend)
  - This template creates the S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and GitHub OIDC provider in a single deployment

  </details>

  ### Quick Start

  Follow these steps to get started with this Atmos Pro example:

  1. **Fork this repository**
     - Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this repository on GitHub

  2. **Deploy prerequisites**
     - See the "Required Prerequisites for Using Atmos Pro (Advanced Example)" section above for deployment options

  3. **Install the Atmos Pro GitHub App**
     - Follow the [Atmos Pro documentation](https://atmos-pro.com/docs) to sign up for Atmos Pro and install the GitHub App in your forked repository.

  4. **Set up GitHub Variables**
     - `ATMOS_PRO_WORKSPACE_ID` - Your Atmos Pro workspace ID. [Find your workspace ID](https://atmos-pro.com/docs/configure/workspaces).
     - `ATMOS_VERSION` - The version of Atmos to use (e.g., `1.181.0`)
     - `ATMOS_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to your Atmos configuration file (e.g., `atmos.yaml`)

     For more information about GitHub variables, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables).

   Now to test it out, create a pull request and let Atmos Pro do the rest!

   For example, you can modify an example component in `stacks/orgs/ex1/plat/dev/us-east-2/demo.yaml` and create a pull request on GitHub to trigger the Atmos Pro workflows. Try changing the value of `foo`, sit back, and see what happens!

  ### How it works

  This example demonstrates a comprehensive configuration for using Atmos Pro with GitHub Actions. The workflow follows these steps:

  <details>
  <summary><strong>On Pull Requests</strong></summary>

  When a pull request is created or updated, Atmos Pro triggers [`atmos terraform plan`](.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-plan.yaml):

  1. **Developer makes a change** - You modify your infrastructure code
  2. **Code is pushed to feature branch** - Changes are committed and pushed
  3. **GitHub Actions trigger Atmos affected stacks** - Atmos identifies which stacks are affected by your changes
  4. **Atmos uploads affected stacks** - The affected stack configurations are uploaded to Atmos Pro
  5. **Atmos Pro dispatches plan workflows** - Atmos Pro automatically runs `atmos terraform plan` for affected components
  6. **Atmos Pro updates status comment** - Results are posted as a comment on your pull request

  This gives you visibility into what changes will be made to your infrastructure before merging.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><strong>On Merged Pull Requests</strong></summary>

  When a pull request is merged, Atmos Pro triggers [`atmos terraform apply`](.github/workflows/atmos-terraform-apply.yaml):

  1. **Pull request is merged** - Your changes are merged into the main branch
  2. **GitHub Actions trigger Atmos affected stacks** - Atmos identifies which stacks need to be updated
  3. **Atmos uploads affected stacks** - The affected stack configurations are uploaded to Atmos Pro
  4. **Atmos Pro dispatches apply workflows** - Atmos Pro automatically runs `atmos terraform apply` for affected components
  5. **Atmos Pro updates status comment** - Deployment results are posted as a comment on the merged PR

  This ensures your infrastructure changes are automatically deployed when code is merged.
